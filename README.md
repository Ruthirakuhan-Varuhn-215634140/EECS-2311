This repository holds all the work that was done strictly on the course projects. This
includes all the code that was used and modified from the startup of the project to now.
The "Documentation" folder contains the: "Testing Document", "User Manual", and
"Requirements Document", and "Design Document". The original .docx version of each file along with the PDF 
version have also been added to the "Documentation" folder.

All the commits done regarding the coding aspects of this course were done in the repository "Midterm_repository". 

The Java code includes Javafx and JavaIO imports to run the Venn Diagram Application. To access all the code, go to the 
"Midterm_Repository" where you can then get to the "Venn" folder, then the "src" folder where you will be able to access the main methods
and the tester.
