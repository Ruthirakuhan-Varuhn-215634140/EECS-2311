This repository holds all the work that was done strictly on the course projects. This
includes all the code that was used and modified from the startup of the project to now.
The "Documentation" folder contains this README file along with the: "Testing Document",
"User Manual", "Requirements Document", and all the source code that was modified and 
used for this application. The original copy for each document and a PDF version was also
added for easy access and usability.
